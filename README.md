Gateless Gate Sharp is yet another OpenCL ETH/XMR miner for Windows operating systems. It focuses on performance, stability, and ease of use.
Unlike the original Gateless Gate or excavator/NiceHash Miner 2, this miner aims at stability with a much simpler design and the managed .NET Framework.

* [Gateless_Gate_Sharp_0.0.15_beta_Setup.msi](https://github.com/zawawawa/GatelessGateSharp/releases/download/v0.0.15-beta/Gateless_Gate_Sharp_0.0.15_beta_Setup.msi) (Windows x64 Installer)

Currently, the miner supports Ethash/daggerhashimoto, CryptoNight, and the following major pools: NiceHash, ethermine.org, ethpool.org, DwarfPool, Nanopool, and mineXMR.com. All you have to do to mine is to download and run the installer, launch the miner, enter your wallet address(es), and click the Start button. The miner is yet to be fully optimized, however, and the first official release will be available when it is feature-complete. When you are upgrading, please make sure to **uninstall the previous version first** before installing a new one.
