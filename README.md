Gateless Gate Sharp is the first open-source OpenCL dual ETH/XMR/PASC/LIBC miner for Windows operating systems. It focuses on performance, stability, and ease of use.
Unlike [the original Gateless Gate](https://github.com/zawawawa/gatelessgate), this miner aims at stability with a much simpler design and the managed .NET Framework.
