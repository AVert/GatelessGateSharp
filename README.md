Gateless Gate \# is yet another OpenCL ETH/XMR/ZEC miner for Windows operating systems. It focuses on performance, stability, and ease of use.
Unlike the original Gateless Gate or excavator/NiceHash Miner 2, this miner aims at stability with a much simpler design and the managed .NET Framework.

Currently, the miner supports Ethash/daggerhashimoto and the following major pools: NiceHash, ethermine.org, ethpool.org, DwarfPool, and Nanopool. All you have to do to mine is to build the miner with Visual Studio 2013, launch the miner, enter your wallet address(es), and click the Start button. The miner is yet to be fully optimized, however, and the first release will be available when it is feature-complete.
